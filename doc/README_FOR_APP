CUSTOMIZATION

All images should go in public/images/ and public/javascripts/ for javascript.

If you want to include metadata, modify app/views/layouts/_metadata.html.erb,
otherwise delete the file.

Custom CSS stylesheets should go in the public/stylesheets/custom_styles/ folder,
and named screen.css, and print.css for the screen sheet and the print sheet,
respectively.

Custom headers and footers go in app/views/layouts/custom_layout/ and should be
named _header.html.erb and _footer.html.erb, respectively.

The only other part of the app that should need editing are the static pages.
They live in app/views/pages/
