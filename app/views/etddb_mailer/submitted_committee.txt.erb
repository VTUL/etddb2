Good news, committee members!

<%= @authors.pluck(:last_name).zip(@authors.pluck(:first_name)).map { |o| o.join(", ") } .join("; ") %> just submitted their ETD!
You are recieving this email because you are on their committee for the ETD "<%= Sanitize.clean(@etd.title).squish %>".
Once you review the ETD, which is here: <%= etd_url(@etd) %>,
you can vote on it on the reviewboard page, which is here: <%= etd_reviewboard_url(@etd) %>.

Thanks,
ETDDB
